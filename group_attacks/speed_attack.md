# Speed Attack (SA)

A speed attack is best used when you don't want to give your opponent enough time to react to the attack.

## Count Down SA

1. The leader will make sure everyone is ready
2. The leader will give a countdown. Something like 5... 4... 3... 2... 1..
3. The leader will then say something like "GO!", and everyone will send their fleets
4. After sending your fleet, you will then spam the 50% and/or 25% speedup buttons to get there as fast as possible.

## Gift Time SA

1. The leader will make sure everyone is ready
2. The leader will give a [gift time](#gift-time) for when to go.
3. The leader will then say something like "GO!", and everyone will send their fleets
4. After sending your fleet, you will then spam the 50% and/or 25% speedup buttons to get there as fast as possible.

## Gift Time

The gift time is the countdown until the packs reset, in the top right.
