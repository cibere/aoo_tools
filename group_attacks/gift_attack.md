# Gift Attack (GA)

A speed attack is best used when you don't want to give your opponent enough time to react to the attack.

## Useage

1. The leader will post a [gift time](#gift-time), which will be the arrival time.
2. Everyone will then add their time to the arrival time. This will be your departure time. (To get your time, go to the target, click attack, click on the formation you are going to use, and note the time.)
3. Watch the gift time, and when there is 1-2 seconds before your departure time and the gift time match, count in your head down to 0 while getting ready to send your fleet, and once you get to 0, send your fleet.

## Gift Time

The gift time is the countdown until the packs reset, in the top right.
