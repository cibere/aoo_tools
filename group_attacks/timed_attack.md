# Timed Attack (TA)

A TA is used when there are a couple people who want to do an attack together.

## Runthrough

1. Whoever is leading the TA will post a target
2. Everyone who wants to participate will send their time in alliance chat. (To get your time, go to the target, click attack, click on the formation you are going to use, and note the time.)
3. Once everyone has posted their times, the leader will tell whoever has the longest time that they can go. This is typically done by saying "@whoever on you"
4. Whoever has the longest time will then tell everyone that they are going. This is typically done by saying something like "G5", which means "Going in 5 seconds".
5. Everyone will go into the "Alliance Battles" section, find the battle, and watch it until there is 1-2 seconds before it matches the time that they shared. They will then count down to 0 in their head, while getting ready to press the "Send" attack button. Once they get to 0, they will press the button.

If everyone did this correctly, everyone will arrive at the same time.s

## Catching Up

If you are within 5 seconds of the main group, you will be fine. If you are more than 5 seconds early, then you can ask people to use speedups to save you, but you can either recall or take the loses. If you are more than 5 seconds behind you can either arrive late, or use speedups.

### 25% Speedup

Take the amount of time inbetween your time and your desired time, multiply it by 4, then when your fleet gets too that time use a 25% speedup

### 50% Speedup

Take the amount of time inbetween your time and your desired time, multiply it by 2, then when your fleet gets too that time use a 50% speedup
